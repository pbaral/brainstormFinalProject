1) Create a calculator with basic addition, subtraction, devsion, multiplication functions
    - Maybe is able to use PEMDAS
2) Create a tic-tac toe game with 1's and 0's instead of x's and o's
3) Make a password generator
    -ask the user how long the password should be
    -how manny letters, numbers, and symbols they want
    -password has to be more than 8 characters
    -maybe have the password in the form of a phrase so the user can remenber it better
4)Make a conversion tool for physics based on the real life equations
    -from Kilogram to Neutons
    -from Acceleration to Kilogram to Net force
    -calculate the gravational field between 2 objects based on the size ratio, mass, and the distance apart between the 2 objects
5)Create a list of objects for the computer to draw in front of your eyes
    -if possible, 10 things for the computer to draw
    -list the objects in order from 1-10 so when the user types the corrosponding number, the computer draws that cooresponding drawing
6)Make the card game "WAR"
    -Try to incorporate graphic design if I can on the cards
    -Have the computer choose 1 number between 1 and 13 randombly, and the user given a number between 1 and 13 randomly
        }only have 4 sets of 1 number like in real cards
    -Whoever has the higher number takes the cards
    -Once all 52 cards have been gone, end the game and count the cards
        }any card =<10 is worth 10 points, any card below 10 = 5 points
        }Ace is always worth 10 points
    -Add up all the numbers on the opposing sides and who ever has the highest number is the winner
    

Plan A: Conversion tool for physics
Plan B: Objects for the computer to draw
